      <description>So I recently bought a stratocaster and an amp.
DI box A DI box is a device that turns high-impedance instrument level to a low-impedance microphone level. The signal during the process is also balanced.
A practical setting would be connecting the guitar/bass to the microphone input. The advantages?
you can clone the signal to another output that&amp;rsquo;s not being affected by the amplifier. This pure signal from the instrument can later on be processed through, say, an emulated amplifier of your choice.</description>
