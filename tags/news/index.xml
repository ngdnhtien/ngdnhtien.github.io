      <description>It has been a remarkable experience participating in The University Physics Competition of 2021. We have had a wonderful 48 hours of brainstorming, discussing, and certainly debating. We shared ideas, new ways of thinking and learn a thing or two about writing, teamwork, and certainly some physics.
From top to bottom: Thang, Tien, Van. I’d like to thank Dr Luu Manh Quynh for his generosity and support, and Viet Anh for sharing his insights during the preparation process for UPC 2021.</description>
