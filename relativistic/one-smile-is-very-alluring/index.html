				<p><em>Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, 30/05/2019</em></p>
<p>Day 01</p>
<p>We were looking for a coffee shop after hours of playing League of Legends. The parental-control-free first year of college gave us more excitement than we have imagined.</p>
<p>We stopped by a famous one, The Coffee House. I didn’t even know the name of the street, but wandering around Phu Nhuan in rush hour is not that smart, obviously.</p>
<p>Day 05</p>
<p>We came back, just because my friend told me about the endearing girl at the bar. I could not remember the last time I saw someone whom as alluring with a smile as her.</p>
<p>Day 10</p>
<p>I’ve developed a tendency to order ‘bạc xỉu vừa’ (Vietnamese coffee with condensed and a touch of fresh milk), without intending to, because I was so nervous talking to her. “It’s been a while since the moment I got butterflies in my stomach.”</p>
<p>Day 12</p>
<p>The rainy season has already begun in Sai Gon. The rain came pouring down the street, bringing freshness to the city as drawing both of us attention. I would never forget the moment we caught each other’s eyes unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Day 15</p>
<p>Came to the coffee shop, alone, again, and as usual, bạc xỉu vừa. I still had one month until the new semester, so being with her, surrounded by the fragrance of coffee was not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Day 16</p>
<p>I started to think about her all day long.</p>
<p>Day 20</p>
<p>My phone rang, it was my friend.</p>
<p>– Hey, are you at the place?
– I am. – And how ’bout your girl tday? Is she at work?
– Yes, right here. Just glanced at her. – I bet 100000 VNĐ that your summer will ended up having no conversation with her.
– Stfu, I’m doing it.
– Doing what?
– I am asking her out!
– 😱</p>
<p>Here came the rain again, each steady, soft drop falling off the roof. I mustered up all courage I had, crossed the long-table and walked straight to the bar.</p>
<p>– May I help you? she asked.
– Yes…one Banh mi Giam Bong…please. I mumbled, without looking into her eyes. What the hell am I doing?
– Can I have your membership barcode?</p>
<p>I handed her my phone, quaky and shivering, with the Facebook search bar that had already been typed in:</p>
<p>Cậu cho tớ xin Facebook được không?</p>
<p>She stopped for a second, looked up, and smiled, the most beautiful smile that I have ever seen in my life.</p>
