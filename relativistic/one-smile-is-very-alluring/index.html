				<p><em>Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, 30/05/2019</em></p>
<p>Day 01</p>
<p>We were looking for a coffee shop after hours of League of Legends. The parental-control-free first year of college gave us more excitement than we had imagined.</p>
<p>We stopped by a famous one, The Coffee House. I didn’t even know the name of the street, but wandering around Phu Nhuan in rush hour is not that smart, obviously.</p>
<p>Day 05</p>
<p>We came back, just because my friend had told me about the endearing waitress at the bar. I couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time I saw someone with a smile as alluring as hers.</p>
<p>Day 10</p>
<p>I’ve developed a tendency to order ‘bạc xỉu vừa’ (Vietnamese coffee with condensed and a touch of fresh milk), without intending to, because I was so nervous talking to her. <a href="https://katieusualthings.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/between-you-and-me-what-is-left">“It’s been a while since the moment I got butterflies in my stomach.”</a></p>
<p>Day 12</p>
<p>The rain season has begun in Sai Gon. They came pouring down the street, bringing a smell of freshness to the city while drawing both of our attention. I would never forget the moment we caught each other’s eyes unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Day 15</p>
<p>Came to the coffee shop, alone, again, and as usual, bạc xỉu vừa. I still had one month until the new semester, so being with her, surrounded by the fragrance of coffee was not a bad idea.</p>
<p>Day 16</p>
<p>I started to think about her all day long.</p>
<p>Day 20</p>
<p>My phone rang, it was my friend.</p>
<p>– <em>Hey, are you at the place?</em><br>
– <em>I am.</em><br>
– <em>And how ’bout your girl tday? Is she at work?</em><br>
– <em>Yes, right here. Just glanced at her.</em><br>
– <em>I bet 100000 VND that your summer will end up having no conversation with her.</em><br>
– <em>Stfu, I’m doing it.</em><br>
– <em>Doing what?</em><br>
– <em>I am asking her out!</em><br>
– 😱.</p>
<p>Here came the rain again, each steady, soft drop falling off the roof. I mustered up all courage I had, crossed the long table and walked straight to the bar.</p>
<p>– <em>May I help you?</em> The waitress asked.<br>
– <em>Yes&hellip;One Banh mi Giam Bong, please.</em> I was mubling. Dare I had the guts looking into her eyes. What the hell am I doing?<br>
– <em>Can I have your membership barcode?</em></p>
<p>I handed her my phone, shaky and shivering, with the Facebook search box that had already been typed in.</p>
<p><em>Cậu cho tớ xin Facebook được không?</em></p>
<p>She stopped for a second, looked up, and smiled, the most beautiful smile that I have ever seen in my life.</p>
