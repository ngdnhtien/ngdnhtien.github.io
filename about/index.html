<h3 id="academic">Academic</h3>
<p>I was once a student of the <a href="http://www.pfiev.hcmut.edu.vn/pfiev/">PFIEV program</a> at <a href="https://hcmut.edu.vn/en">HCMUT</a>, before making a quantum leap to become a physics student at <a href="http://english.hus.vnu.edu.vn">VNU University of Science</a>.</p>
<p>As part of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=L_NTUcoAAAAJ">Hung</a>’s group, my research interests center around circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture for quantum information processing, specifically high-dimensional control and characterization of superconducting transmon circuits.</p>
<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p>I completed my first term as the Head of Academic Affairs at HUS Physics Club (2020-2022). We create engaging physics-related forums, build coherent communities, and promote the love for physics.</p>
